## now we release code or images (or both)

Now that you have a working CI process with a successful test, the next step is releasing your code.

Releasing your code can mean pushing your Docker image out to an image repo like Dockerhub or deploying your code to Amazon or AWS. Or both!

## you'll need a Codeship with Jet account

The first link you'll need is a working Codeship with Jet account. If you haven't used up a 14 day free trial yet, you can [sign up for one here.](#)

If you have an account already - or, once you've activated your free trial - you'll want to create a new project. When creating your new project, make sure to select the Docker infrastructure after choosing the repo you're using.

If you don't have a repo configured, just create a new repo on Github and push the code examples we're using so far.

## you'll also need a Dockerhub or Quay account (and Heroku/AWS/etc)

## let's do a push

## look at web ui

## a push PLUS a deployment

## up next: using volumes
